# OpsVantage platform — App scaffolds

This repository now contains two app scaffolds:

- `opsvantage-cms` — Strapi backend (SQLite) with content types for Posts, Announcements, TeamMembers.
- `opsvantage-web` — Next.js TypeScript frontend with Tailwind and a small UI component library under `opsvantage-web/ui`.

Follow the READMEs in each folder for local setup. Protect `.env.local` files and add required secrets to GitHub.
